# Svahaa.com

Using HTML and CSS for front-end, and PHP and MySQl for back-end, I implemented Svahaa.com, and E-Commerce Website for Pooja Samagri. The website is hosted via Xamppâ€™s localhost Apache Server and The database is maintained on localhost phpmyadmin.

Steps to implement project:-

#1 Install Xampp and start Apache and MySQL server.
#2 put this project's entire folder in the folder htdocs in Xampp folder.
#3 Import login_db.sql from database into your localhost phpmyadmin under new database login_db.
#4 in connection.php, change your mysql username and password according to your system.
#5 type localhost/Svahaa/index.php on your desired web browser.
